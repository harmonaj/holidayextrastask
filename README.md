Please follow these instructions for the deployment of the Web API.  This has been produced with Node js, React and Mongo DB/Mongoose.  You will only need to ensure that Node is installed for this to work, everything else is installed automatically through the commands seen below. The Mongo DB database is hosted online at MongoDB Atlas, so please ensure that you have an active internet connection for this to run effectively.

Please note that this app has been left in development mode and has not been built.



1) Download/clone the Github repository into a directory or area of your choice.

2) Ensure that Node is installed on your respective operating system, if it is not already.  It can be found at (https://nodejs.org/en/).  Instructions to install it depend on your operating system, so cannot be fully explained here.

3) Load up Terminal or your respective CLI for your operating system.

4) Switch to the directory where the Github repository has been downloaded to (or go to where the clone of it is), typically with the 'cd' command.  For example, if your repository has been downloaded as a zip file and is in a folder called 'webpapi' in your root diretory, a command such as 'cd webapi' may switch to it.

5) Type in 'npm install' and let the application download all required dependencies.

6) Type in 'npm start' to launch the Web API.  It should automatically open up an internet browser window (using your default installed browser) and from there you can use the system.
